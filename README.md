## Site Purpose

This site was created as part of STAT228 at Simmons University. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my data science work, particularly focused on R programming and statistical visualization. Over time, I plan to expand this site to include work from other classes, research labs, and independent projects.

## Projects

### Mini-Project 1: NBA Clutch Performance

This project explores how the Boston Celtics perform in high-pressure, late-game situations using clutch statistics. I used tidyverse tools to clean and analyze performance data and visualize player stats during the final minutes of close games.

### Mini-Project 2: NBA Salaries and Performance

In this project, I analyzed the relationship between NBA player salaries and their on-court performance. I explored salary distributions, performance outliers, and created comparative plots to examine trends.

## STAT228 Final Project: The Three-Point Revolution

**Title:** *The Three-Point Revolution: How Efficiency Behind the Arc Predicts NBA Team Success (2003–2023)*

**Description:**  
In this project, I explored whether three-point shooting efficiency (3P%) predicts NBA team success across 20 regular seasons (2003–2023). Using R for data cleaning, visualization, and linear modeling, I found that higher 3P% is a statistically significant predictor of win rate. The results highlight the strategic value of long-range shooting in today’s NBA.
